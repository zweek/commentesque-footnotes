# Comment-like Footnotes for Obsidian

This plugin adds shortcuts to quickly add new footnotes to your notes that can be used similarly to comments in apps like Google Docs or Notion. 

**Default shortcuts:**

`Ctrl + Shift + M` - Insert automatically numbered footnote<br>
`Ctrl + Alt + M` - Insert custom named footnote<br>
These same shortcuts also let you navigate between the main text and a footnote when your cursor is on the corresponding marker or word(s) next to the marker.

![]()

Select a piece of text and the shortcut will add a `==highlight==` around it, followed by the footnote.

![]()

Footnote markers will automatically be placed at the end of a word if your cursor is inside a word.

## Credits

The base functionality (i.e. shortcuts for creating & navigating footnotes) is based on the existing [Footnote Shortcut](https://github.com/MichaBrugger/obsidian-footnotes) plugin.

### Features that would be pretty cool and awesome and epic

- A preview of the content of the footnote when hovering the mouse over the marker (as if it was a normal link to a different note). Similarly to what [this plugin](https://github.com/aidenlx/better-fn) does
